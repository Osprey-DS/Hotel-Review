When I called the front desk about the extra bed I requested, it was explained to me since we have two beds they could not accommodate us with a rollaway. Why give that an option during booking but not available during the stay? Overall it was a nice experience. \\n  \\n  Read more\\n  Read less   \n",

       "1063  Disappointing stay all around. I’ve stayed at various hotels for a while & the way the trip started with having to park your vehicle in such an uncomfortable way made the start in a sour way. The fact that the parking for the guests was on the opposite side of the building because valet took the other side made it very disappointing. When I went to park my car the pass code wasn’t given so I had to drive upstairs & was almost involved in an accident due to the driver next to my vehicle almost hit my car due to the tight fit. Upon entering my hotel room the smoke alarm sensor was going off & I had to go downstairs & alert the staff this annoying situation I could go on & on but luckily my stay was only for two days & not longer.

       "1219  Negative - I choice this hotel and paid more to stay here because it had the valet parking that several others in the area did not have. There was another hotel with limited hotel parking that was less and we chose not to stay there because we know how the parking in NY can be. Yet, on the 2nd night we arrived back at 4AM from being out with my family and was told that the valet was full. This was absolutely ridiculous. My husband then had to park over two blocks away on the street. If we wanted street parking there were many other hotels that were less expensive where we could have stayed. What also makes matters worst is I called this hotel before book to confirm the valet parking and they did not mention that it's limited valet. \\n \\n Positive - The front desk staff was pleasant, ch...   \n",

Great location but that's it. The New Yorker was probably the height of fashion in the 1930s but that's probably when it was last renovated. If you enjoy a time travel experience where you are woken by the rattling pipes at 5am every time someone in a room around you uses the bathroom then you will love it. Probably best for those deep sleepers only. Definitely not New York's finest. \\n  \\n  Read more\\n  Read less   \n",
